I started off writing this blog/journal in public. However, I soon realised that I was not being authentic to myself writing it on the internet for everyone to see. Thus, I decided to move it offline to make it more personal. 

However, I would like to share my setup that I think would work for you. I love it, its great and I already cherish it, and I can't wait to look back on it. 

I use [Logseq](https://logseq.com) with [this theme.](https://piotrsss.github.io/logseq-tools/public/#/bujo-themes)

I like to write about my day, what I'm grateful for, what's been on my mind, my feeling and thoughts (about anything), and anything that I would like to remember. In the end, its the small things that make the biggest difference, and I want to remember all the small things. Sometimes, with tunnel vision focus on something (e.g. a class), is easy to lost perspective of time or how far we've come or personal growth or what really matters. Writing about the present in the present and coming back to it later helps us come back to a past self and be proud of them for how far they have come, while reminding us that whatever is happeing right now, life will find a way and things will be all right.
